# Pokemon Trio

A small web page that displays 3 Pokémons chosen at random from PokeAPI.co, along with their Pokédex data.

The Pokémons are first hidden in Pokéballs. The user has to click on the Pokéball to reveal the Pokémon.
He can then choose wether to keep this Pokémon, or open another Pokéball.

When the user has chosen a Pokémon, the other are revealed. Their Pokédex data is still accessible until
the user clicks on the replay button.

The page can be viewed at http://gperouffe.perso.centrale-marseille.fr/visible/pokedex/
